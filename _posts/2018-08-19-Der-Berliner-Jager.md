This is a 3 part series about my recent job hunting experience in Berlin. I've definitely lead more interviews than I've taken, so these tips come from both sides of the interview panel.

### My Hunting Tips
Here's a summary of my iOS job hunting advice:

- Update your [resume]({{ site.url }}/assets/SampleCoverLetter.pdf) and trim any outdated (less relevant) experience
- In your [cover letter]({{ site.url }}/assets/SampleResume2018.pdf), write **enthusastically** about why you want to work at the company
- Over prepare for interviews
	- Study up on iOS basics - [iOS Interview Questions](https://medium.com/@duruldalkanat/ios-interview-questions-13840247a57a)
	- Complete simple coding exercises - [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com)
	- Practice long answer* questions **out loud**
		1. Tell us about your previous work experience
		2. Why should we hire you?
		2. Why do you want to work here?
		3. Tell us about a difficult interaction with a colleage
		4. Describe a challenging engineering problem you resolved
- Practice describing your career experience out loud, as a story. Ensure this is a compelling story that concludes with the company
- Revise your [cover letter]({{ site.url }}/assets/SampleResume2018.pdf) and [resume]({{ site.url }}/assets/SampleCoverLetter.pdf) before each interview - this will be your interviewer's primary reference
- Reiterate your genuine enthusiasm at each step of the process
- Plan questions that you want to ask the interviewers
	- If you genuinely have none, explain why, rather than flounder for one
